                    The bankâ€™s reliable conveyance of innovative financial arrangements and excellent client support has
                    empowered it to
                    record yearly development in the number of customers and key financial files since the beginning.
                    Due to
                    the major age
                    group using this bank, many are committed to using the mobile service option, including the USSD
                    code
                    and the available
                    mobile application. Although the bank has released different versions of the mobile application on
                    the
                    app store, many
                    issues have continually been raised over the inefficiency of the application and its difficulty to
                    use,
                    which forces
                    users to revert to the less sophisticated means of performing transactions. Over time, I have had
                    many
                    issues where I
                    cannot perform basic tasks like making cash transfers or buying airtime and eventually had to use
                    the
                    USSD code for
                    transactions.

                    Gtbank today is one of the top 5 banks in Nigeria and undoubtedly has the largest youth
                    concentration in
                    Nigeria and one
                    of the biggest African banks. The bank operates on a total asset value worth 3.287 Trillion Naira
                    and a
                    Shareholders
                    support worth 575.6 Billion Naira and has more than 10,000 workers. Due to these challenges
                    experienced
                    by me and many
                    other youths, I decided to rethink the entire experience of the app and create solutions to these
                    problems. I will be
                    using the GTWorld app as a case study for this purpose.

                    A user-friendly app is meant to be learnable with the smallest effort invested, unfortunately, the
                    GTWorld app is a bit
                    difficult to use, especially when looking for new features to explore. While I was using the app, I
                    experienced some
                    glitches without understanding why and many other people have highlighted similar challenges as
                    well.
                    Meanwhile, I also
                    needed to hear from other mobile app users to understand what pain points others are experiencing. I
                    scheduled meetings
                    with some users to ask about their experiences and watch them use the app. Some of the issues that
                    were
                    repeatedly
                    reported by users are listed below:

                    seamlessly perform
                    those tasks, I studied their reactions to validate whatever challenges they may have experienced
                    while
                    using
                    the app. I
                    discovered these pain points during the course of the interview.

                        Cryptly was designed for new Cryptocurrency users who originally would have little idea of what
                        to look at or what
                        actions to take. The home screen is designed to have your current balances reflect how much you
                        have on your portfolio,
                        how much youâ€™ve earned or loss in percentage and as well the actual amount in your original
                        currency. The CTAs as well
                        are boldly placed so users can take quick action as they use the app.

                        The existing homepage design on the app was full of clusters of unused items and confusing app
                        navigation. This was
                        highlighted to be one of the app's pain points as users were unable to locate key features
                        needed to
                        perform tasks. This
                        problem was solved by removing the unused features, we paid more priority to the features that
                        are
                        most needed by the
                        customers

                    Many other parts of the UI got redesigned as one of the goal is to give a full visual redesign of

                    The focus of this redesign was centered around delivering an all-new experience on the GTBank
                    application. Based on the
                    research and feedback I had gathered, it was certain that the UI of the app was one of the major
                    channels causing many
                    setbacks for the app's performance and a fix would really help users interact better. I learned the
                    newer ways to see
                    problems and how to solve them, the most effective part of my contribution was looking for an easier
                    way to covey the
                    exact same information on the existing design without losing any key information, which I am sure I
                    was able to achieve
                    after testing the design out with some users
                </p>

                <p class="conclusion-details font-sf text-primary text-sm lg:mt-8">
                    I am happy I was able to work on a project like this, I enjoyed every brainstorming session I had
                    with my partner on
                    this project as well as the audience I interviewed as everyone was truly willing to give their
                    sincere response and
                    feedback throughout the entire design process.

                    I would love to workon a web version of the GTBank app as that as well needs a total revamp.
