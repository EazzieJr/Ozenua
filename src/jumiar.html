            Mobile commerce will outpace non-mobile commerce in 2021. In 2021, mobile commerce sales will account for
            more than half
            of total e-commerce sales. Today, one-third of purchasing decisions are influenced by researching products
            on mobile
            devices. More than half of retailers already have a mobile app. As much as people have gotten used to the
            idea of
            e-commerce, there are still some purchases for which we need a little bit more contextual information. That
            can be a
            barrier to selling certain product categories online.

            AR technology could offer immersive solutions to close the online and in-store shopping experience gap. More

            Jumia is the leading pan-African e-commerce platform active across 11 countries on the continent. The
            platform consists
            of a marketplace connecting thousands of sellers to millions of consumers, with integrated logistics and
            digital payment
            services. Jumia Marketplace offers goods from a large and diverse group of sellers across various

            much in need

            One of the challenges of online shopping is not being able to test out
            what you want to purchase, so you have to deal with the disappointment after delivery. But with the
            integration of AR technology, customers can now practically test out the product from their mobile devices
            by adding the item into their environment in real-time. Not just that, customers can now scan products
            anywhere and make purchases directly from their Jumia app.

                        To make the whole mobile experience uniform and the AR feature, we decided that the home screen

                        tweak and we gave a minimalistic design and has the AR feature right there at the users' reach.
                        Users can easily search
                        using the object recognition on the search bar that allows them to scan an object. The app shows
                        a list of results
                        available on the Jumia inventory or tests a product from their cart using the AR feature at the

                The entire design process of this concept design was totally a new experience for me as a designer. I
                got the
                opportunity to further learn to understand the basic principles of AR technology and how it affects
                human life and
                experience. Getting resources to help me focus was very tasking as of the time I started the design
                process there were
                barely any quality materials to help navigate, so I had to improvise in some areas, I also had to learn
                a bit of 3D
                modeling and the concept of 3D geometry. Finally, creating realistic 3D-like angles on Figma was a
                completely
                mind-blowing experience for me as I never actually thought I'd have been able to do so at first.
            </p>

            <p class="conclusion-deats jumiar-deats lg:mt-8">
                Next time, I will like to work on easier flows for this design and incorporate it into the application's
                web
                version. I
                also intend to learn 3D modeling to create more precise angles for a more realistic and improved
                experience. Thank
