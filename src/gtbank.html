            <p class="about-gt-deats gt-deats">
                The bankâ€™s reliable conveyance of innovative financial arrangements and excellent client support has
                empowered it to
                record yearly development in the number of customers and key financial files since the beginning. Due to
                the major age
                group using this bank, many are committed to using the mobile service option, including the USSD code
                and the available
                mobile application. Although the bank has released different versions of the mobile application on the
                app store, many
                issues have continually been raised over the inefficiency of the application and its difficulty to use,
                which forces
                users to revert to the less sophisticated means of performing transactions. Over time, I have had many
                issues where I
                cannot perform basic tasks like making cash transfers or buying airtime and eventually had to use the
                USSD code for
                transactions.

                Gtbank today is one of the top 5 banks in Nigeria and undoubtedly has the largest youth concentration in
                Nigeria and one
                of the biggest African banks. The bank operates on a total asset value worth 3.287 Trillion Naira and a
                Shareholders
                support worth 575.6 Billion Naira and has more than 10,000 workers. Due to these challenges experienced
                by me and many
                other youths, I decided to rethink the entire experience of the app and create solutions to these
                problems. I will be
                using the GTWorld app as a case study for this purpose.

                A user-friendly app is meant to be learnable with the smallest effort invested, unfortunately, the
                GTWorld app is a bit
                difficult to use, especially when looking for new features to explore. While I was using the app, I
                experienced some
                glitches without understanding why and many other people have highlighted similar challenges as well.
                Meanwhile, I also
                needed to hear from other mobile app users to understand what pain points others are experiencing. I
                scheduled meetings
                with some users to ask about their experiences and watch them use the app. Some of the issues that were
                repeatedly
                reported by users are listed below:
            </p>

            <ol class="list-decimal gt-deats lg:mt-10 lg:ml-5">
                <li>Increased volume of transactional errors.</li>
                <li>The app goes blank and that gets users confused.</li>
                <li>Navigating around the app is tasking.</li>
                <li>DSeveral complain about airtime purchase issues.</li>
                <li>Lack of proper error feedback</li>
                <li>Other issues include Typography, colors and visual hierarchy</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="font-caudex text-white text-lg lg:mt-10">Here are some customer reviews on the Google app store

            <p class="gt-deats">
                In addition to this, I also set simple tasks for the users to perform to know if they will be able to
                seamlessly perform
                those tasks, I studied their reactions to validate whatever challenges they may have experienced while
                using
                the app. I
                discovered these pain points during the course of the interview.
            </p>

            <ol class="list-decimal gt-deats lg:my-10 lg:ml-5">
                <li>Users had to pause once they are successfully logged in to find menu options despite using the
                    application <br> before.</li>
                <li>Users reportedly conmplained about some part of the app going blank whenever you click on text

            <p class="gt-deats">
                To further validate my research, I went on to the google play store app to check out what users of the
                app
                had to say
                about their experiences.

                To better the experience, I will be working on creating simpler flows for the onboarding, major
                features, and other
                hidden features that could be helpful for users. By creating simple user flows, I will be able to
                provide easy
                navigation for the application.

                After creating the information architecture for the app, I was able to narrow down the flows and core

                After completing the finished designing the user flow, I make sketches on the app interface on paper,
                creating a
                first-hand view of the ideas I had in mind for what the UI may look like later in the future.

                Wireframes help me focus on key functions, elements, and actions before starting the visual design. I
                created
                High-Fidelity wireframes using some dummy texts and icons where needed.

                Designing the visuals became very interesting after being able to validate the wireframes with potential
                testers of the
                app. I proceeded to design a simple design style guide for the application.

                Making a bank application friendlier would most likely improve users' trust in the application, as the
                app is perceived
                to be more reliable. So we decided to begin this from the very first screen.

                The onboarding process on the app was a pain as forms were confusing and mostly leaves the users
                clueless on what
                direction to take. So we focused on improving that experience by providing conventional flows and simple
                easy to fill
                forms for users to onboard on the app.

                <p class="gt-deats lg:my-8">
                    The existing homepage design on the app was full of clusters of unused items and confusing app
                    navigation. This was
                    highlighted to be one of the app's pain points as users were unable to locate key features needed to
                    perform tasks. This
                    problem was solved by removing the unused features, we paid more priority to the features that are
                    most needed by the
                    customers

                Several times when using the app there tends to be situations when the app suddenly stops working and
                users don't know
                why that happens. Giving the users notice to what event is causing these errors is a major ingredient to
                improving the
                user experience and make the users be in control of what's happening on the app.

                research and feedback I had gathered, it was certain that the UI of the app was one of the major
                channels causing many
                setbacks for the app's performance and a fix would really help users interact better. I learned the
                newer ways to see
                problems and how to solve them, the most effective part of my contribution was looking for an easier way
                to covey the
                exact same information on the existing design without losing any key information, which I am sure I was
                able to achieve
                after testing the design out with some users
            </p>

                I am happy I was able to work on a project like this, I enjoyed every brainstorming session I had with
                my partner on
                this project as well as the audience I interviewed as everyone was truly willing to give their sincere
                response and
                feedback throughout the entire design process.
            </p>

                I would love to work on a web version of the GTBank app as that as well needs a total revamp.
